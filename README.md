## Abstract
Mental health issues in adolescents are a growing concern globally. Identifying potential issues at an
early stage is critical to ensuring timely interventions and preventing long-term mental health complications. This paper
describes the design and development of a screening app aimed at identifying possible mental health issues in
adolescents. The app utilizes well-established screening tools and includes a user-friendly interface that enables
adolescents to provide responses confidentially. Results indicate that the app is effective in identifying possible mental
health issues in adolescents and could be an essential tool in the early identification of potential mental health issues.
